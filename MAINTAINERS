List of maintainers and how to submit changes
=============================================

If you wish to submit code, we recommend first reaching out to the maintainers,
who will advise you on the precise procedure they wish to use.

We also request you follow these basic guidelines:

1.  Make sure you test your changes on both 32- and 64-bit versions of  Windows.

2.  Make sure your changes do not introduce any new prefast warnings.

3.  All submissions must be made under the terms of the "Developer's Certificate
    of Origin" (DC) and should include a Signed-off-by: line.

2.  All Submissions should use Unix line endings for consitency with the rest of
    the XenServer project.

3.  Each patch should include a descriptive commit comment that helps understand
    why the patch is necessary and why it works. This will be used both for
    initial review and for new people to understand how the code works later

4.  Make sure you have the right to submit any changes you make. If you do 
    changes at work you may find your employer owns the patches instead of 
    you.
